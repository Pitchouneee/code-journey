# 🚀 Code Journey

## 🎬 Presentation

**Code Journey** is **React + TypeScript** tool that lets you easily create multi-step code animations to enhance your technical presentations. The goal of this project is to break down a code snipper into multiple steps and animate those steps to visually highlight changes, additions, or refactorings in a progressive and engaging way.

> 💡 **Project origin :**
> When preparing technical slides, it can be tricky to clearly show how a piece of code evolves. Code Journey solves this by providing a dynamic, step-by-step preeiw that guides your audience through th **journey** of the code -- from the initial version to the final result.

* 🔄 **Auto-play** with **Play/Pause** controls
